## Requirements

You will only need Node.js and a node global package, NPM (for example), installed in your environment.

Secondly, you will need a Discord Bot (see: https://discord.com/developers/). Google will help you as well creating a Bot account ðŸ˜‹

You should turn on all Privileged Gateway Intents, and have Administrator permissions for your Bot.

Generate a token for this Bot, and paste it in .env file: "TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE".

If you want to print kick message in a specific channel, then get the ID of this channel and put it in .env file the same way: "MAIN_CHANNEL=YOUR_CHANNEL_ID"
